üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.7+

    pip (Python package manager)


1. Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash cmd/ linux terminal

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-growth-monitoring-system.git
cd plant-growth-monitoring-system

  2. Install required dependencies:

bash cmd/ linux terminal

pip install -r requirements.txt

  3. Run the application:

bash cmd/ linux terminal

python app.py


**Configuration**

The system can be customized through several aspects:

    Database: Modify init_db() in app.py to use different database systems

    Data Collection Interval: Adjust the time.sleep() value in collect_internal_sensor_data()

    Chart Parameters: Modify the chart configuration in the HTML templates

    Device Timeout: Change the online/offline threshold in devices.html




**  Development**
Adding New Sensor Types

    Extend the database schema in init_db()

    Add new API endpoints for dataÊé•Êî∂

    Update the appropriate dashboard template to display the new data

    Modify the data collection functions to handle the new parameters

Customizing Dashboards

The chart configuration in the HTML templates can be modified to:

    Change chart types (line, bar, etc.)

    Adjust visual styling and colors

    Modify data ranges and scales

    Add new data visualizations

**üåê Deployment**

For production deployment, consider:

    Using a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)

    Setting up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx)

    Implementing HTTPS encryption

    Using a more robust database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

    Adding authentication and authorization

    Setting up proper logging and monitoring


**    Acknowledgments**

    Built with Flask

    Charts powered by Chart.js

    Example client using Requests
